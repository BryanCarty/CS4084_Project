# Project Work Breakdown CS4084
> **_NOTE:_** Due to technical difficulties with Git, Denis was unable to commit many of his changes via his own account.
To workaround this issue, he emailed his changes to myself (Bryan Carty) and I committed them via my account.
The below breakdown is the correct breakdown of our contributions.
